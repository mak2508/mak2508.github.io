Welcome!

I work on turning research projects into commercial products under the Research Engineering division at QCRI. Some of the projects I have worked on include JUDO, SIHA, and TASRIF.

I received my BSc in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. I was recognized as a [Andrew Carnegie Society Scholar](https://www.cmu.edu/engage/give/donor-recognition/andrew-carnegie-society/acs-scholars.html) for my graduating batch.

Recently, I have been investigating techniques to improve the convergence rate in the learning of deep networks. We are also looking into ways similar techniques can be applied to transformers. I do this work with [Dr. Amin Sadeghi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Viogmi8AAAAJ&hl=en) outside of my work hours, to get exposure to research and Deep Learning.
